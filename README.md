# JEEP.COM FRONT PAGE PROJECT

I built this website replication from scratch as part of a coding challenge for a Software Developer postion with a startup in North Austin.

* [tehcnical specifications](#specs)

* [testing and build process](#tests)

## Specs

The challenge is pretty straightforward. Recreate an exact copy of the current jeep.com front page. The only constraints specified by the client were that I must use Twitter bootstrap to build it (no specific version. 3 or 4 are both acceptable). This application, just like the original page, must also be fully mobile responsive.

A preliminary examination of the jeep.com website indicates that they're using Webpack, React, jQuery, Google Analytics, and possibly an adobe CMS. I'll attempt to stick to the technologies in use and limit the use of any technologies, frameworks, or libraries that are not in use on the real website.

## Tests

I'll place any relevant tests here as I built this website.
